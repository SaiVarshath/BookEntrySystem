ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The provided code is a **Library Borrowing System** implemented in C++. It manages books and users, allowing functionalities like adding books, registering users, borrowing, and returning books. Books have attributes such as `ID`, `title`, `author`, `genre`, and availability status, while users are identified by `ID`, name, borrowed books, and fines. The system uses file-based persistence to save and load book and user data from text files (`books.txt` and `users.txt`).

Key features include:
- Adding and listing books with availability status.
- Registering users and maintaining their borrowing history.
- Borrowing and returning books, updating statuses dynamically.
- Persistent storage to retain data across program runs.

Potential improvements include robust file parsing, enhanced user experience, fine calculation, and advanced search and filter capabilities. This system serves as a foundational library management tool with room for further enhancement.
